VISITORS ACCESS DEVICE

Problem Statement:

To avoid overlapping of the people during visiting hours in the crowded areas.

Solution:

To overcome this we have come up with an idea:
when a visitor enters the hospital he/she should give his unique identity like email address or phone number to the receptionist.
The receptionist will generate QR-Code based on the unique id.
After which the visitor can scan the QR-Code and move inside the ward.
When the visiting hour is expired we can give him/her alarm as a automatic phone call.
So ,this helps to create an alert for the visitors and decreases crowd.
